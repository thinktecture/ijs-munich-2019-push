# Advanced Progressive Web Apps: Push notifications under control

Christian Liebel ([@christianliebel](https://twitter.com/christianliebel)), International JavaScript Conference 2019, Munich.

For sure, Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are one of the hottest topics on the web today. A PWA should feel like a real app, including the ability to show push notifications. In this talk, Thinktecture’s Christian Liebel (@christianliebel) will show you how to implement push messaging in your PWA or website using the Push API, including a look at helpful libraries and third-party services. As a part of Google’s Project Fugu, push notifications will get even better thanks to the advent of the Badging API and Notification Triggers.
